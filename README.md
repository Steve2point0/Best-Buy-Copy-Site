# Best-Buy-Copy-Site
This is a copy of the front page only. The original site uses an adaptive design which isn't very responsive to screen sizes.

I used Bootstrap for the majority of the layout and functionality. The original site I believe uses React and Tailwind.

Custom CSS was used to adjust img sizes, font-size and background-colors.

The original site isn't generally responsive, however a few items like the bottom half of the navbar stacks the links into a Dropdown as the screen shrinks.

Carousels are used on the majority of the site with dynamically populated data. I obviously can't reproduce that. My focus was the general layout using Bootstrap.

Also the Carousels in Bootstrap only allow width adjustments that don't collapse the (x) margins or padding. So using the w-25 only shrinks the image
  so each item is still full width of the Carousel. That's annoying.
